# Epic 2: User Interface Development

## Overview
Build an intuitive graphical user interface for the Markdown to PDF converter, focusing on user experience and real-time preview capabilities.

## Goals
- Create a user-friendly GUI for document editing and conversion
- Implement real-time Markdown preview
- Provide intuitive configuration options
- Ensure smooth integration with core conversion functionality

## User Stories

### UI1: Basic GUI Setup (5 points)
**As a user, I want a basic GUI with a text area and file upload button**

Tasks:
- [ ] Set up GUI framework (PyQt/Tkinter)
- [ ] Create main window layout
- [ ] Implement text editor component
- [ ] Add file upload/save functionality
- [ ] Integrate with core converter

Technical Considerations:
- Choose between PyQt and Tkinter based on requirements
- Ensure proper file handling and error management
- Maintain clean separation between UI and core logic

### UI2: Real-time Preview (8 points)
**As a user, I want a real-time preview panel for Markdown rendering**

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement preview panel
- [ ] Create preview update mechanism
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for editor
- [ ] Implement split view functionality
- [ ] Add preview refresh controls

Technical Considerations:
- Handle preview performance optimization
- Implement efficient update mechanism
- Consider caching for better performance
- Handle large document rendering

### UI3: Configuration Interface (5 points)
**As a user, I want a section to configure conversion settings**

Tasks:
- [ ] Create settings panel
- [ ] Implement template selection
- [ ] Add page setup options
- [ ] Create style configuration
- [ ] Add settings persistence

Technical Considerations:
- Design intuitive settings layout
- Implement configuration storage
- Ensure settings validation
- Provide sensible defaults

## Timeline
1. Week 1: UI1 - Basic GUI Setup
2. Week 2: UI2 - Real-time Preview
3. Week 3: UI3 - Configuration Interface
4. Week 4: Testing and Refinement

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **GUI Layer**
   - Main Window
   - Editor Component
   - Preview Panel
   - Settings Dialog

2. **Controller Layer**
   - Document Controller
   - Preview Controller
   - Settings Controller

3. **Integration Layer**
   - Core Converter Interface
   - File Handler
   - Configuration Manager

### Technology Stack
- GUI Framework: PyQt/Tkinter
- Preview Engine: WebView component
- Editor: Custom text editor with syntax highlighting
- Settings: JSON/YAML configuration

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Individual component testing
   - Controller logic verification
   - Settings management

2. **Integration Tests**
   - GUI-Core interaction
   - File handling operations
   - Settings persistence

3. **UI Tests**
   - User interaction flows
   - Layout responsiveness
   - Cross-platform compatibility

## Dependencies
- PyQt6/Tkinter
- Markdown preview library
- Syntax highlighting package
- Configuration management library

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Performance**
   - Implement preview throttling
   - Use efficient update mechanisms
   - Consider background processing

2. **Cross-platform**
   - Use platform-agnostic widgets
   - Test on multiple OS
   - Handle path differences

3. **User Experience**
   - Regular user feedback
   - Intuitive default settings
   - Clear error messages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] UI tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User feedback incorporated

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Choose and set up GUI framework
3. Create initial window layout
4. Begin implementing UI1

## Future Considerations (Epic 3)
1. **Cross-platform Packaging**
   - Create installers
   - Handle dependencies
   - Manage updates

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile application
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Improve startup time

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Plugin system
   - Theme support
   - Advanced export options
